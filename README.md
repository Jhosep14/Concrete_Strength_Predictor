# Concrete_Strength_Predictor

Compressive strength can be defined as the capacity of concrete to withstand loads before failure. Of the many tests applied to the concrete, the compressive strength test is the most important, as it gives an idea about the characteristics of the concrete. AI makes posible predict it and ensure the good elaboration of concrete.
